# Buildin a Microbial Foods MAG dataset and a Microbial foods gene catalog
Here we are gathering code and documentation to build a microbial foods MAG dataset and a microbial foods gene catalog

We are uptdating documentation about all the datasets and samples considered. 

There will be code:
- to study the diversity coverage of the different microbial foods MAG databases,
- to join and repreplicate MAG collections
- to build step by step the MAG datasets from internal samples
- to build a MAG-derived gene catalog
- to run some diversity and taxonomic analysis on internal samples using the resource created

Data included:
- [cFMD](https://github.com/SegataLab/cFMD)
- [MiFoDB](https://mifodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Internal samples from Microbial Foods dept at [DTU-Biosustain](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/)
